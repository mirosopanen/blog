## Why I am starting a daily blog

At the beginning of March, I am going to start writing a daily blog. Basically, it means that every day at 4 pm. There are a couple of reasons why I am going to do this daily blog.

### Reasons to start a daily blog

1. Learning English

Even I am a final year high school student and I have completed all mandatory English classes in our school system, my English writing and speaking lacks. To change that I think writing daily in English will help me to learn it more.

I think this won't work only for me but everyone else too. I really recommend you to start this challenge too for 30-days for example.

2. Building a habit of writing

Some time ago I figured out this same exact idea. Even though the idea was great I did not take an action and didn't start writing and building the habit of it. I actually tried it but didn't stick on it. Now I am going to change that...

### Conclusion and ending

Even I know there won't be any readers out there, I am starting this project. This may sound quite stupid but even though I am going to take the step to create a new habit of writing daily.
